### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for VisuaEAS. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). Fill out [the required template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* **Check the [currently open issues]()** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

* **Check if the problem has been fixed** by attempting to reproduce the issue using the latest code in the repository.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.

* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started VisuaEAS, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut or an IDE code shortcut.

* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).

* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.

* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.** If you're suggesting a change/improvement, explain why you believe it would be useful.

* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool]() on Linux.

* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information. For example, explain if you were working on a specific project or file.
