## Visualizing the world's current (and past) warnings and advisories

VisuaEAS is a web application that visualizes the world's current (and past) warnings and advisories. It tries to answer the question: "What is happening in the world right now?". The current method of grabbing warnings is via RSS Feeds of all supported countries's Meteorological Services and any further methods (EAS Radios/Feeds, user submitted warnings, etc.).
